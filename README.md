# w32api
Common Lisp Win32API / WinRT bindings (generated from Windows Metadata, so should be 100% complete - once done)

Still in early stages, but all that is needed is to implement a few JSON -> CFFI translations + a bit of gruntwork, and everything should automagically work ;-)

**IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH CFFI, ASDF, OR HAVE PREFERENCES WRT GIT SUBMODULES, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT OPEN ISSUES / SEARCH FOR TODO: IN CODE, ANY HELP WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED**

API JSON files:
 - taken from https://github.com/marlersoft/win32json
 - generated by https://github.com/marlersoft/win32jsongen
 - many thanks !!!!
